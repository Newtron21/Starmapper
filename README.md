## Description
‚Äã
Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:
‚Äã
- What was your motivation?
- Our motivation for this project was we wanted to know what constellations are above me in the sky, as well as how to use web api calls and encorporate them into a webpage.
- We built this project to create a fun website people can go to, input their city, and get back a constellation and what it looks like in the sky. We wanted practice with web API calls
- The problem it solves is we have a lot of light pollution in this day and age, this webpage allows us to see constellations as well as see what stars are around them, you could do this for fun or to learn more about star maps
- We learned how to do API fetch calls (experimenting with APIs that have no instruction), how to work together in a group and make sure we are all actively participating and learning at the same time. We learned how to work on a github repository together and make sure we werent overriding other peoples work. 

‚Äã
